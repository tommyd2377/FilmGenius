## What is FilmMatch?
FilmMatch is a web based movie trivia game. Usernames and their respective high scores will be stored in a simple NoSQL database.

## Initial thoughts on game structure

At this point I think my biggest challenge will be writing all of the trivia questions and uploading them into the database manually. I am also exploring the use of an open source trivia api for the questions.

## Phases of Completion
First, I will create a project in Firebase to persist the questions and scores in a database. Then, I will generate the project repo locally and remotely, then create the individual project pages and files. I am going to write out the template, styling and the business logic needed to interface with the database. I need to fetch questions and answers for current users, and then update the high scores after each game.
